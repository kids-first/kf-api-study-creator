A study mimics a study within the Data Service. It encompasses a group of
similarly collected data.

File

A file symbolizes the ideal and complete formulation of a specific
subset of a study's data. The essence of a file may need to be iterated on,
improving the underlying representation to better match the true form of the
file.

Version

An version is a materialization of a file in the form of an on-disk
representation.
It tracks the exact file contents at a given point and its ``state`` in the
process of being consumed into the Kids First database.
